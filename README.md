## About the project:
This porfolio features a fine webpack 5 and React template out of the box, I urged to get it working because create-react-app didn't support webpack 5 at the time, I tried to get around it by ejecting, but found myself that it was easier to start from scratch to learn it

It has a SEO-first approach, in which I try to load the critical styles first (inline or by importing) and then apply a patch with the styles that are not critical. Images have low-resolution fallbacks in order to have a nice FCP (First Contentful Paint). The entire loading process is designed to be as smooth as possible, even under poor internet conditions.

I worked a lot on boilerplate, some features are still missing, it is in WIP state and lighthouse SEO dropped a little (it's easy to fix)

## SEO
